# bclock - a multi-handle clock.

The clock has got an hour handle and a minute handle. However,
additional hour handles can be added to show time is other
timezones. This is helpful if you're working with teams across
multiple timezones and you want to get an impression of what
everybody's time is.

# How to run it
You need:
```
pip3 install colour
```

Run
```
python3 bclock.py config.json
```
